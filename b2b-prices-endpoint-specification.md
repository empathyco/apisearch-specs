# Custom Prices Endpoint Specification

This document outlines the specification for a **Custom Prices Strategy** within Apisearch. A custom prices strategy is required when Apisearch receives a page of results, and due to the complexity of pricing (e.g., customer-specific prices or advanced pricing calculations), an intermediate server-side call is needed before displaying final product prices. This call is done by the client's browser; than means that will carry the user session in order to find specific prices. A better explanation will be placed at the end of this document.

By following this specification, the custom prices strategy can be seamlessly integrated with Apisearch, enabling dynamic and flexible pricing for complex use cases.

## Endpoint Overview

The integration requires a server-side endpoint that accepts a single query parameter named **`ids`**, which contains a comma-separated list of product IDs. The endpoint returns a JSON response where each product ID maps to its corresponding pricing details.

### Request Example

```http
GET https://endpoint.com/path/?ids=1,2,3,4
```

### Response Example

The response is a JSON object. Each product ID from the query parameter maps to an object containing its pricing information:

```json
{
    "1": {
        "p": 12,
        "p_c": "12 EUR",
        "op": 15,
        "op_c": "15 EUR",
        "wd": true,
        "dp": 15
    },
    "2": {
        "p": 30,
        "p_c": "30 USD",
        "wd": false
    }
}
```

### Response Object Structure

Each product object includes the following fields:

* `p` (float): Current price of the product.
* `p_c` (string): Current price of the product including the currency.
* `op` (float, optional): Original price before discount (if applicable).
* `op_c` (string, optional): Original price before discount including the currency (if applicable).
* `wd` (boolean): Indicates whether the product has an active discount (`true` or `false`).
* `dp` (integer, optional): Discount percentage, included only if the product has an active discount.

#### Example Field Behavior

* A product with a discount:

```json
{
    "p": 12,
    "p_c": "12 EUR",
    "op": 15,
    "op_c": "15 EUR",
    "wd": true,
    "dp": 15
}
```

* A product without a discount

```json
{
    "p": 30,
    "p_c": "30 USD",
    "wd": false
}
```

### Notes and Recommendations
* **Efficiency**:
  The endpoint must be highly optimized, as it will be called every time new products are rendered. Minimize latency and ensure scalability to handle frequent requests.
* **Optional Fields**
  Fields `op`, `op_c`, and `dp` are included only for products with an active discount (`wd` set to `true`).

## Implementation strategy

This endpoint must be designed to return specific prices for a particular user. To achieve this, each client must access the userâ€™s session in the same way it is done in the rest of the online store. There is no rule for this, since in each case it is handled in a completely different way. Given that the implementation of this endpoint will be carried out 100% of the time by a technical department, it is assumed that each store will know how to retrieve the customer-specific price.

> [!WARNING]  
> Any delay in this endpoint could negatively impact page load times and user experience. Ensure that the endpoint is as fast as possible.
